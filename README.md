TLS protocol implementation simulation

This project implements a simplified Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol in Python, designed for secure authentication, key exchange, and encrypted communication between simulated IoT devices. The implementation demonstrates all major TLS phases—including handshake, RSA key exchange, and AES-based symmetric encryption—over a TCP socket connection. Performance metrics such as runtime and memory usage are measured to highlight the protocol’s efficiency and suitability for resource-constrained IoT environments.
